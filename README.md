# Personal Powershell Profile
Make PowerShell profile look good with themes and neat shortcuts.

## Themes
JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh prompt theme engine was used to make the customization of the powershell happen.

## Fix Missing Fonts
Make sure to install nerd fonts for missing fonts to be fixed, in my case, Hack Bold Nerd Font was installed.
